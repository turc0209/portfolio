# Aya Turchio - Portfolio

## Project Description
This project is based off of a design mock-up I made for my *UX/UI Design course*. I very much enjoy making visual designs in **monochrome** colour schemes. I hope that my light and dark blue design is appealing and shows my strengths as a designer. 
I wanted a website that would showcase my art clearly. The Glider.js carousels allowed me to achieve this in the way that I wanted.

### Challenges
Getting some of my *aesthetic choices* implemented in a functioning and responsive way proved quite difficult at times! For example, the lines on either side of the header element across the pages involved a lot of fine-tuning that I wasn't expecting while I was creating the design mock-up.
Changing some of the elements that Bootstrap has pre-made was a challenge for me. For example, the header and footer nav bars were difficult to re-position from their intial designs.

### Lessons Learned
-**CDNs** are very useful and really streamline the building process.
-Bootstrap's ability to center and format divs is very useful.
-Function is more important than design at times (or all the time).
-It's important to keep working on other areas of the website when you get stuck in one area.
